Refactor play phase to keep variables of current player?
It is starting to become quite hard to keep track of what is happening in it.
Might also be solved by more functions.

Might want to mirror the hand passed to the players inside the cribbage.cpp such that the players can't cheat.
Might be nice to have once I start doing search.
So that I can make sure that the players are playing cards actually in their hand.

Currently a player could change the cards in his hand, and then play the changed card.

GUI? or at least some semi parseable text output

Create clock to log how long it takes to play 1 game

Multi-processing?
