Might want to mirror the hand passed to the players inside the cribbage.cpp such that the players can't cheat.
Might be nice to have once I start doing search.
So that I can make sure that the players are playing cards actually in their hand.

Currently a player could change the cards in his hand, and then play the changed card.

Should also include tear down and deletion of classes.

GUI? or at least some semi parseable text output

Create clock to log how long it takes to play 1 game

Multi-processing?
